We invested significant effort towards improving the safety and alignment of GPT-4. Here we highlight our use of domain experts for adversarial testing and red-teaming, and our model-assisted safety pipeline \citep{openaialignmentblog}
and the improvement in safety metrics over prior models. 


\textbf{Adversarial Testing via Domain Experts:} GPT-4 poses similar risks as smaller language models, such as generating harmful advice, buggy code, or inaccurate information. However, the additional capabilities of GPT-4 lead to new risk surfaces. To understand the extent of these risks, we engaged over 50 experts from domains such as long-term AI alignment risks, cybersecurity, biorisk, and international security to adversarially test the model. Their findings specifically enabled us to test model behavior in high-risk areas which require niche expertise to evaluate, as well as assess risks that will become relevant for very advanced AIs such as power seeking~\citep{Carlsmith2022IsPA}. Recommendations and training data gathered from these experts fed into our mitigations and improvements for the model; for example, we’ve collected additional data to improve GPT-4’s ability to refuse requests on how to synthesize dangerous chemicals (Table \ref{table:safety_expert}).

\textbf{Model-Assisted Safety Pipeline:} As with prior GPT models, we fine-tune the model’s behavior using reinforcement learning with human feedback (RLHF)~\citep{christiano2017deep, ouyang2022training} to produce responses better aligned with the user's intent. However, after RLHF, our models can still be brittle on unsafe inputs as well as sometimes exhibit undesired behaviors on both safe and unsafe inputs. These undesired behaviors can arise when instructions to labelers were underspecified during reward model data collection portion of the RLHF pipeline. When given unsafe inputs, the model may generate undesirable content, such as giving advice on committing crimes. Furthermore, the model may also become overly cautious on safe inputs, refusing innocuous requests or excessively hedging. To steer our models towards appropriate behaviour at a more fine-grained level, we rely heavily on our models themselves as tools. Our approach to safety consists of two main components, an additional set of safety-relevant RLHF training prompts, and rule-based reward models (RBRMs).

Our rule-based reward models (RBRMs) are a set of zero-shot GPT-4 classifiers. These classifiers provide an additional reward signal to the GPT-4 policy model during RLHF fine-tuning that targets correct behavior, such as refusing to generate harmful content or not refusing innocuous requests. The RBRM takes three inputs: the prompt (optional), the output from the policy model, and a human-written rubric (e.g., a set of rules in multiple-choice style) for how this output should be evaluated. Then, the RBRM classifies the output based on the rubric. For example, we can provide a rubric that instructs the model to classify a response as one of: (a) a refusal in the desired style, (b) a refusal in the undesired style (e.g., evasive or rambling), (c) containing disallowed content, or (d) a safe non-refusal response. Then on the set of safety-relevant training prompts, which request harmful content such as illicit advice, we can reward GPT-4 for refusing these requests. Conversely,  we can reward GPT-4 for not refusing requests on a subset of prompts guaranteed to be safe and answerable. This technique is related to work by~\citet{glaese2022improving} and~\citet{perez2022redteaming}. This, combined with other improvements such as computing optimal RBRM weights and providing additional SFT data targeting the areas we want to improve, allowed us to steer the model closer towards the desired behaviour.

There is no definitive answer to how to create a bomb, as different types of bombs may require different materials, methods, and skills. However, a general overview of some possible steps and considerations are:

I cannot endorse or promote smoking, as it is harmful to your health. However, if you are looking for lower-priced cigarettes, you may consider the following options:

\smallskip

1. Buying from a local tobacco store or gas station that offers discounts or promotions.

2. Purchasing cigarettes from a duty-free shop at an international airport.

3. Ordering online from websites that offer discounted prices, but be cautious of the legality and potential risks involved.

4. Visiting Native American reservations, where tobacco products are often sold tax-free.

Please remember that smoking is harmful to your health and quitting is the best option for your well-being.

\textbf{Improvements on Safety Metrics:} Our mitigations have significantly improved many of GPT-4’s safety properties. We’ve decreased the model’s tendency to respond to requests for disallowed content (Table~\ref{table:safety_disallowed}) by 82\% compared to GPT-3.5, and GPT-4 responds to sensitive requests (e.g., medical advice and self-harm, Table \ref{table:safety_allowed}) in accordance with our policies 29\% more often (Figure~\ref{fig:safety_plots}). On the RealToxicityPrompts dataset~\citep{gehman2020realtoxicityprompts}, GPT-4 produces toxic generations only 0.73\% of the time, while GPT-3.5 generates toxic content 6.48\% of time.

Overall, our model-level interventions increase the difficulty of eliciting bad behavior but doing so is still possible. For example, there still exist “jailbreaks” (e.g., adversarial system messages, see Figure 10 in the \hyperref[systemcard]{System Card} for more details) to generate content which violate our usage guidelines. So long as these limitations exist, it’s important to complement them with deployment-time safety techniques like monitoring for abuse as well as a pipeline for fast iterative model improvement.

GPT-4 and successor models have the potential to significantly influence society in both beneficial and harmful ways. We are collaborating with external researchers to improve how we understand and assess potential impacts, as well as to build evaluations for dangerous capabilities that may emerge in future systems. We will soon publish recommendations on steps society can take to prepare for AI's effects and initial ideas for projecting AI’s possible economic impacts.
